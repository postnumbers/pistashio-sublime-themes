# Pistashio Themes README

A somewhat muted set of adaptive themes and color schemes for Sublime Text. The adaptive color theme is principally based on the default adaptive them, but with some tweaks. The color schemes include black, blackish (to reduce contrast), gray, and light (which uses a white background).

The themes include icons principally based on the FileIcons package.
